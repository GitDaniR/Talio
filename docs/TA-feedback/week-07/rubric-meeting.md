#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chair: Daniel Rachev
Minute taker: Konstantin Kamenov


#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Perfect like last weeks!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Could be formatted a bit better, together with more complete sentences, but overall fine!


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

Really good like last weeks.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Excellent_

Good like the past weeks.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

There is definitely a shippable product present. Some final features need to be finished/polished, but I am excited for the final application. Don't forget that websockets + long polling are a requirement!
