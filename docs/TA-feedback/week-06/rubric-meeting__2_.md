#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chair: Rūta Giedrytė
Minute taker: Alexandru Fazakas 


#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Good agenda, follows the template well! Really like the "main-topic" part, and the clear descriptions under each action point.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

The notes have been put in the agenda file and there a good amount of them. For next time it would be nice to see people assigned to certain tasks in a clear overview somewhere in the notes (e.g. a table). Other than this the formatting could be a little bit better, but this is not a big deal.


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

Chair leads the meeting well and covers all topics for an appropriate amount of time! Also makes sure everyone is involved.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Excellent_

Friendly and constructive athmosphere, and everyone could safely bring up any concerns while others take those comments into account. Really good that everyone can be honest! Keep doing what your doing because the project and meetings are all going well!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

You presented the main branch again, and there was good progress from last week! You guys are well on track for a (very good!) working application at the end of the project. Only reason I don't give excellent on this part is that there were 1 or 2 bugs during the demo.
