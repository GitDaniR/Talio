#### Focused Commits
_Very Good_

You started comitting the first real commits this week, and the amount of them is fine for now, however it should increase the coming weeks. Commits are usually about one single coherent change to the system, which is nice to see. Lastly, commits messages are mostly good, but can sometimes be a little clearer, like changing "Started working on Board Overview" in commit *1280510c* into 2 commits, 1 where you create a Board Controller, and another where you switch up the template code with new code for the board overview. This is to keep all commits coherent. 


#### Isolation
_Very Good_

The (feature/code) merge requests that have been made the past weeks are nicely done. The pace of them should increase the following weeks, but for now it is a great start. The MR's contain isolated features, have a clear decription. There are branches open which all cover a specific feature, which is good to see! (except the branch named after one of you, maybe remove/rename that one :).


#### Reviewability
_Very Good_

The MR's from the past week have a clear title and all contains a description. The ammount of commits they contain are also fine. The changes the MR's bring are coherent and mostly seperate. I really like how the (code) MR's are looking, so keep it up. The following weeks when there are more MR's I can give more feedback on how to imrpove. For now I can say that the description could be formatted better/more detailed, so that a person not involved with the code can almost fully understand what the MR's brings.


#### Code Reviews
_Good_

Code MR's all have reviews by others which is really nice to see. The reviews are constructive and purposefull! Not all comments are answered with by the MR's creator, which is not always nesseary, but it would be nice to see the creator at least react to some comments.



#### Build Server
_Good_

There are a good amount of pushes/commits, so the there is a build CI/CD runs frequently. The frequency should increase the following weeks, but I think that won't be a problem. The builds fail somestimes, but are almost always fixed soon after which is really good to see (and fixing them all directly after a failing build would be perfect)! Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you only have the default checkstyle rules, and it would be nice to see at least 10 checkstyle rules implemented for the build server.
