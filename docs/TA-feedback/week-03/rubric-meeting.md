#### Meeting Organization
Chair: Konstantin Kamenov
Minute taker: Daniel Rachev

_Pass_

There are a different chair and minute taker, it was decided before the meeting, and mentioned in the agenda, which is nice to see!


#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

The agenda was added to the repository on time, it follows the template well, and there were good points chosen (and accompanied by a small description). One thing is that I would like an agenda point every week where you show off your application for a couple minutes. Other than this, keep it up!!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very Good_

I already gave some feedback about the minutes from last week, but I will do it again here. The notes are merged into the agenda file, which is very good to see! When reading the notes you should be able to understand the main points from the meeting, even if you were not present, and that is also the case with these notes, so that is good! For next times, make sure to clearly mention if there are tasks that need to be completed, and who is doing them.


#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

The chair made sure each topic was clearly covered and for a good amount of time. The meeting went very well, and the only thing to improve here is that the chair can make sure they lead the discussions better.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

You all had a good meeting and there was ownership taken of the meeting. Everybody was participating in the meeting which was good to see! There was a nice athmosphere which was friendly and contructive. Everyones ideas were also listented to. This point is close to excellent, and can be improved by having more involved discussions.



#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You presented the current state of the application when I asked about it, and for next time it would be nice to have it as an agenda point. For now this section is sufficient (which is the most you could have gotten for this week!), but next week there should be a "working" (ofcourse not finished) application, on the main branch, with changes compared to last week.
