### Submission
_Fail_

The document should be submitted as a PDF file, so make sure this will be reformatted correctly,


### Backlog Structure
_Pass_

The structure is in a logical ordering and visually looks good. The list of stakeholders is fine, but the exact role of the admin can be expanded (what should they be able to do (exactly) on the application?). The termininology is looking good. The list is of user stories is also prioritized correctly. It is also nice to see that the mockups are put in the backlog too, but make sure to reference them in the user stories as well.


### Epics
_Sufficient_

There exist an epic that contains the minimal application's requirements, which is good. However after that there is only one epic, "Additional Requirements", however this should be expanded into multiple new epics (with each of them being a bigger extra feature), which should have been covered in the lectures. Each epic should then contain a corresponding description of what they entail, followed by the user stories, together with a mockup.


### User Stories
_Very Good_
The user stories are all in the correct format, which is nice to see, and are focussed on the user perspective. They are for the most part clear without any overlap. However the user stories are currently not fully covering the epic's description, which should be done for the final backlog. Lastly the requirements are not contradicting and there is minimal overlap. 


### Acceptance Criteria
_Good_
The user stories are all concise and are not overloaded. The clarity is also well enough that one can easily tell if a user story is completed or not.
