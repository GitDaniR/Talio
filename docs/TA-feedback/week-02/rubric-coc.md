### Submission
_Pass_

COC is put in the correct place.

### General
_Sufficient_
All sections have been answered, but some could be more detailed, like the "Commitment" and "Dealing with conflicts". How do you measure commitment? When can't a conflcit be resolved?


### Assignment Description
_Good_

THe description is correct, but it can be explained what project needs to be made (and not just saying "similar to Trello").

### Products
_Sufficient_

What working application needs to be delivered at the end? You can be a little more detailed on what standards you need to adhere to?

### Planning
_Insufficient_

How do you make sure team members are following the planning? Is anyone responsible for submitting assignments for the group? What if someone is not on track during the periodic checkups?

### Communication
_Sufficient_

When do you guys meet besides the TA meetings? Is there a communication plan of when updates are given to the TA?


### Commitment
_Insufficient_

What is a concrete way that quality can be determined? And what is the minium quality that each team member would like to see in the group work/ in the chair + minute takers?


### Division of Tasks and Roles
_Sufficient_

There is a agreement on how the chair/minute takers will be decided, but there could be a planning for all the weeks already, and even give issues to the corresponding chairs already for creating the agenda.


### Meetings
_Sufficient_

There is an agreement of how often to meet, but there is nothing specified how those meetings would look like.


### Decision Making
_Good_

There is a backup plan specified if no consensus can be reached, but there could also be a rule of how to involve TA-feedback with the decision making process.

### Dealing with Conflicts
_Good_

It is mentioned what to do if a conflict can't be resolved, but it could be specified when exactly a conflict can't be resolved by the TA.

### Guidance
_Good_

The expectations are realistic, and it is inspired by course information. Could be improved by asking the TA what they think.


### Consequences
_Sufficient_

Mentions a consequence, but it could be expanded when exactly a person does not fix it. And when can the consequence be handled internally?


### Success Factors
_Good_

Fair points for success factors, but nothing specific to your team.


### Norms or Evaluation Criteria
_Good_

This could be improved by saying why these things are important to the team.
