#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chair: Una Jacimovic
Minute taker: Antonio Lupu

Mentioned in agenda and different people!

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Added in time, follows the template, and all points are clear, structured, and have a clear description. Keep it up like this!



#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Excellent_

Notes have been merged into the agenda file well, and are clear and meaningfull. The focus points + summary action points table is really good to see too. Keep it up like this!


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

Covered all topics well and for an appropriate amount of time. The chair took the leading well, and resulted in a good meeting. Some agenda points were switched around a bit, but in a logical way, so that is perfectly fine.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Excellent_


The team took ownership of the meeting well. Everyone was focussed, involved, friendly and constructive to each other. Ideas and comments were also taken into account well.



#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

There was an agenda point where you present the application, which is nice to see. The main branch had working features (scrollbar + adding boards), which is good, and progress compared to last week. I think you as a team are well on track to create a good working application!
