To get started, you need to input the following:
- ip address (which is usually localhost:8080) of the server you wish to connect to (the
server you choose will dictate what information is already available - if any and where
your data will be saved)
- username - this will represent who you are within the system - all the boards you
have joined will be associated with your username
- admin password - this is optional and is only required when you want to connect
as a privileged user - you will be able to see all boards and have access to their
password; contact the system administrator to request it.
After connecting, you can create a new board to get started. Within boards, you can create lists, tasks and tags to assign to tasks. Once a task is made, it can be double-clicked to be opened.  From there, the title can be changed, a description and subtasks can be added and tags managed. Additional color customization is also available in the same menu.

Tip: double-click on the board title while in the overview to change it! /endShortcut guide:
