# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project

Welcome to TALIO, the only task management system you will ever need!

To get started, you need to input the following:
- ip address (which is usually localhost:8080, though can be any ip reachable by the system - this was tested!) of the server you wish to connect to (the
  server you choose will dictate what information is already available - if any and where
  your data will be saved)
- username - this will represent who you are within the system - all the boards you
  have joined and created will be associated with your username
- admin password - this is optional and is only required when you want to connect
  as a privileged user - you will be able to see all boards and have access to their
  password; contact the system administrator to request it. ( *whispers* it is 123)

After connecting, you can create a new board to get started. Within boards, you can create lists, tasks and tags to assign to tasks. Once a task is made, it can be double-clicked to be opened.  From there, the title can be changed, a description and subtasks can be added and tags managed. Additional color customization is also available in the same menu.

Everything is synced across clients. If you are in the same board as somebody else, you will see the changes in real time.

## How to run it

To run the app, you need to start the appropriate server within your IDE of choice (in our case, the server is Spring, and can be started from the Main in the server package). 
After that you can start however clients you want from the main in client. 

## How to contribute to it

We don't expect contributions from external sources, but if you really want to help us with development, please contact us directly at our email 
so we can discuss and maybe even give you access to the repository.
